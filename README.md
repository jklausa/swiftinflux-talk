#Swift In Flux / Swift Warsaw #1 Talk

Here are slides from my talk at first [Swift Warsaw](http://swiftwarsaw.com)
meetup. 

There's both PDF and source markdown file (sans speaker notes), that I used in
Deckset to generate the slides ("Poster White" theme).

There's also a [video recording](https://github.com/SwiftWarsaw/SwiftWarsaw/blob/master/meetups/1.md) available.
